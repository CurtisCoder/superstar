  <p class="reg-text">The experience of tasting wine can be divided into multiple stages of analysis. This publication will guide you
    through each stage and help you to develop your wine tasting skills until they become second nature.</p>

  <p class="reg-text"> The first stage of wine tasting begins with describing the appearance, or “eye” of the wine, and is followed by an
    analysis of the aromas, or “nose”. The aromas noted by the nose are confirmed by a sensory evaluation in the mouth. Once in the
    mouth, the taster can evaluate the flavours, mouth feel (texture), as well as the body (weight), balance and ultimately the finish.</p>

  <p class="reg-text">When tasting, a tulip-shaped glass is preferable. The shape is important, as the glass begins to narrow towards the
    rim, the aromas become concentrated.</p>

  <p class="reg-text">Notes regarding your tasting experience should be taken in the wine journal, which follows the guide portion of this
    book. The journal is comprised of blank tasting sheets that guide the taster through each stage of the tasting process.</p>

  <p class="reg-text">Anyone can taste and evaluate wine – all it takes is a little practice. In the end, it is your opinion that counts.
    Do not be swayed by what others say. Only you know what you like and what you do not.</p>

  <p class="reg-text">For starters, break out a bottle of wine, pour a couple of ounces in a glass and follow along the next few pages!</p>
